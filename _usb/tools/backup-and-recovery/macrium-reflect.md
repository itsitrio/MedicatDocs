*   protect files and OS via disk imaging technology
*   Macrium Image Guardian (protection against ransomware)
*   create disk images in Windows Explorer for easy recovery

*   backup entire PC or workstation to a single compressed image file
*   full file/folder level backup and recovery
*   email notifications
*   disk cloning
*   backup scheduler


The program has lots of settings, so a new user may be a little confused at first, though it does not take much time to learn the ins and outs.
